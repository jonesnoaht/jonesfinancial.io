	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>Jones Financial was created to support the Certificate of Deposit Token (CDT) project.</p>

	<h3>Certificate of Deposit Token</h3>
	<p>The proposal can be found via <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Zero-interest-penalty-CD-Token/367811-48088">this link</a>. We are partnering with <a href="https://campuscu.com/">Campus USA Credit Union</a>.</p>

	<h3>CDT Summary</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li><p>Credit Unions are non-profit entities with the stated mission of promoting the economic prosperity of local communities.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Certificates of deposits, just like any other account, are insured up to 250,000 USD by the FDIC for banks or the NCUA for a credit union.</p></li>
	  <li><p>The Federal Reserve Bank provides inexpensive audits that can be put on-chain.</p></li>
	  <li><p>Thus, CDs that are federally insured are among the most secure ways to convert fiat currency to a cryptographic stabletoken.</p></li>
	</ol>
      </section>
      <section id="efficiency" class="frame">
	<h3>Efficiency</h3>
	<p>The CDT benefits local communities because the Cardano network has lower transaction fees and lower faster settlement times when compared to the Visa-Mastercard network.</p>
	<p>Banks that issue these loans will benefit from increasing their customer bases, have increased transparency of the movement of funds when making loans, and will be able to offer financial services via smart contracts that would otherwise not be feasible.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="security" class="frame">
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>Because each CDT issuance is discrete, each issuance will be generated by different credit unions and banks. Given NCUA and FDIC insurance and a standardized mechanism for auditability via the <a href="https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/accounting">Federal Reserve Bank Services</a>, any bank or credit union will be able to issue CDs as CDT, and the scope and impact of fraudulent issuances, should they even be possible, are automatically limited in scope.</p>
	<p>We will be offering scrambled seed phrases engraved in steel and stored in safety deposit boxes. One copy will be be given to the customer, and the other copy will be stored in a safety deposit box.</p>
	<p>In our first issuances, KYC will have already been handled as the service will at first only be made available to those who already have an account with the credit union.</p>

      <section id="driverdao-and-others" class="frame">
	<h3>DriverDAO and Others</h3>
	<p>Once we have developed the CDT fiat on-ramp, we would like to offer municipalities the opportunity to issue municipal bonds to encourage the formation of low-overhead administrative structures that create employment opportunities and help to serve the homeless.</p>
	<p>DriverDAO aims to offer peer-to-peer ride sharing.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="business-model" class="frame">
	<h3>Business Model</h3>
	<p>Fees for CDT will be nominal to cover costs. Jones Financial will benefit financially as we will provide training and support services to businesses and financial institutions seeking to integrate CDT into their financial systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="mission" class="frame">
	<h3>Mission</h3>
	<p>Our mission is to build highly reliable bridges and fully compliant bridges from the legacy systems into systems of distributed ledgers.</p>
	<p>We take on projects that can either only be done on a distributed ledger or are fundamentally more efficient when leveraging Cardano. Like Elon, we are attempting to maximize the probability that the future is good.</p>

	<p>I am a biological scientist and immunologist at the University of Florida. You can find my <a href="https://directory.ufhealth.org/jones-noah">profile</a> in the UF Health directory.</p>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/jonesnoaht">Here is my github profile</a>.</p>
	<p>I started my involvement in the first cohort of the Plutus Pioneers Program, and I have been studying and contributing to the community since, with a step up in my activity since I have properly familiarized myself with the core Haskell libraries developed by IOG. I have also been enrolled in the Prism Pioneers Program.</p>
