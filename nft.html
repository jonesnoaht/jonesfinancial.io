      Welcome to our page for purchasing NFTs from drops. This page is
      secured via its hash address through IPFS, and the redirect to
      this page is secured at the level of the domain-name server
      (DNS). To quickly check this page,
      bookmark <q>http://nft.jonesfinancial.io</q> and tap the
      bookmark to refresh the page. Once the DNS has been updated, the
      URL http://nft.jonesfinancial.io will direct you to a different
      page on IPFS where you will be able to access the NFT drop. Hang
      tight and refresh your page once we have hit the drop time. If
      you see this page again, refresh again.

      This is a part-time project, and we would like to spend more
      time securing the ecosystem. However, we all still have day
      jobs. To support the cause, please donate to the following:
